shit I need to do:
	make rfgridCommunications.py
	make rfgridGame.py (which uses rfgridCommunications.py to talk to the arduino)
	change how rfgridBackgroundCalib.py creates and stores background data (should be based on number of squares)
	change how rfgrid.py loads background information (should resize based on number of squares in default.rfgridbg)
	change the default ptext font to UbuntoMono-Regular.ttf
