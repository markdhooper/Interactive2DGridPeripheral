# Interactive2DGridPeripheral
A modular RFID based 2D grid that can detect objects equipped with RFID tags which incorporates a pico projector display.

This will be our project as part of ECED4900 - Senior Year Project course at Dalhousie University.

This project will use modular 4x4 arrays of Mifare RC522 based RFID readers/writers interfaced with an Arduino Uno to TX/RX commands to a host machine which will run a Python based API which will create the requisite graphics and sound based on the state of the peripheral.
